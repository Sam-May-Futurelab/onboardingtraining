                <p>I speak fluent startup. I get that you need things done quickly, cheaply, and right the first time. No fluff, no endless discovery phases, just practical solutions that work for real teams under real constraints.</p>
                <p>My clients are founders and ops leads who value clarity over complexity. If you want someone who can think strategically but ship tactically, we'll work well together.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do I need this if we're still small?</h3>
                    <p>Nope. 10 is the perfect size to fix things before they break. It's cheaper, faster, and less political now than it will be later.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I know when it's time for L&D?</h3>
                    <p>When you're answering the same onboarding questions twice. When new hires take longer than expected to contribute. When you're scaling but systems aren't.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if we're fully remote?</h3>
                    <p>Even better. Remote teams need crystal-clear processes and documentation. No more "just ask Sarah" or hoping new hires figure it out from Slack.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Isn't this what managers should do?</h3>
                    <p>Great managers absolutely should. But most are learning management while doing their day job. I help them get the frameworks and confidence to do it well.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How fast can you move?</h3>
                    <p>I work in startup time. Most engagements start with something usable in week one. Full systems typically take 2-4 weeks, not months.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if this doesn't work for us?</h3>

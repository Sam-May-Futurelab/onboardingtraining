## Brand Positioning

**Target Audience:** Founders and operators at early-stage startups without dedicated L&D resources

**Value Proposition:** Practical, scalable L&D systems that help startups grow without growing pains

**Voice:** Clear, calm, conversational — like a helpful operator, not a corporate coach

## Content Guidelines

- Keep copy punchy: 1–3 sentence max per paragraph
- Use modular, scannable sections ready for designer handoff
- Prioritize clarity and founder relatability
- Avoid corporate jargon and L&D buzzwords

## Reference Brands

Tone inspiration from: Notion, Linear, Superhuman, Vanta, Stripe Press

## Usage

The homepage copy in `content/homepage-copy.md` is production-ready and structured with proper headings (H1, H2, H3) for direct handoff to designers and developers.

## Next Steps

1. Review and refine copy based on feedback
2. Add supporting page copy (About, Services, Contact)
3. Develop visual assets and design system
4. Build website implementation

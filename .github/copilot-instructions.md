# L&D Consultant Website Project

This project contains website copy and content for a freelance Learning & Development consultant targeting startups and small businesses.

## Brand Voice Guidelines
- Clear, calm, and self-assured
- Friendly and smart — like a helpful operator, not a corporate coach
- Slightly conversational — writing with the founder, not at them
- Confident without being salesy — no fluff, no hype
- Modern, thoughtful, and jargon-free
- Reference tones: Notion, Linear, Superhuman, Vanta, Stripe Press

## Target Audience
- Founders and operators at early-stage startups
- Small business teams without in-house L&D leads
- Fast-growing companies that need practical L&D support

## Content Principles
- Prioritize clarity, usefulness, and founder relatability
- Keep copy punchy: 1–3 sentence max per paragraph
- Use modular, scannable, well-structured sections
- Avoid filler text and corporate jargon

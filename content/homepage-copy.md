## Why This Matters

**Still onboarding with Google Docs and hoping for the best?**
Every day without proper onboarding is a day your new hires are figuring it out alone.

**Unsure if your new hires are really up to speed?**
Without clear milestones and check-ins, you're flying blind on readiness.

**Managers doing feedback ad hoc?**
Inconsistent development conversations create uneven team performance.

You don't need a full-time L&D hire—just the right setup, at the right time.

## Why Me

I'm not a corporate trainer with generic frameworks. I'm an operator who's built these systems from scratch at fast-growing companies.

I speak fluent startup—I get that you need things done quickly, cheaply, and right the first time. No fluff, no endless discovery phases, just practical solutions that work for real teams under real constraints.

My clients are founders and ops leads who value clarity over complexity. If you want someone who can think strategically but ship tactically, we'll work well together.
